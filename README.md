Mod Integration Patches
Small ModuleManager config tweaks for part interaction between existing mods or tweaks to mod parts not related to the required tech for part unlock
Also contains rebalanced tech requirements for mod parts for an alternate start scenario with Sounding Rockets


Stock
Tech rebalancing to CTT nodes for stock parts as well as tweaks to Stock parts and Science definitions
Science definitions changed in the following way:
  - EVA reports are not biome dependant and cannot be performed while flying in an atmosphere
  - Crew reports are biome-dependant if in low orbit (to replace EVA report biome dependency)
  - Barometer measurements in space will yield no science
Lastly, contains rebalanced tech requirements for stock parts for an alternate start scenario with Sounding Rockets


Tree
Contains config for one additional node in the tech tree called Zero G Expeditions.
This node is meant for 1.25m station parts and early crew modules (Hitchhiker, etc).
